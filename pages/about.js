              I‚Äôm Pranav Goswami, a front-end web developer and
              designer based in Gujarat, India. I&apos;ve been
              building stuff on the web for the last 2 years. My main
              focus is on creating engaging, accessible & performant
              interfaces on web.
              <br />
              <br />
              My interest in web development started back in 2017, in
              my first year of collage when I discoverd some stunning
              websites -- turns out there&apos;s more to that than
              just only HTML and CSS!
              <br />
              <br />
              Aside from my job, writing about web development and
              design on my blog is something I enjoy. A great deal of
              my time is spent researching new technologies and trends
              which helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, and grow as
              a developer. In my free time, you can find me playing
              chess ‚ôü, reading books üìö, or at the gym üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
